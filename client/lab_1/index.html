<h1>Tyler Deaner Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

<h2>First, the basics.</h2>

<p>You need the following to build your website.</p>

<ul>
    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
</ul>

<p>My top five favorite albums:</p>

<ol>
    <li>OK Computer by Radiohead</li>
    <li>In Utero by Nirvana</li>
    <li>To Be Kind by Swans</li>
    <li>Igor by Tyler the Creator</li>
    <li>Red Burns by Standing On The Corner</li>
</ol>

<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to draw <em>attention</em> to something in a line of text.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <strong> strongly </strong> emphasize something in the text.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sometimes you want to do both.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/> Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br/>
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>

<img src="images/mochi.jpg" alt ="JPG image of mochi"/>
<img src="images/mochi.gif" alt="gif image of mochi"/>
<img src="images/mochi.png" alt="PNG image of mochi"/>
<img src="images/mochi.svg" alt="SVG imageo of mochi"/>

<p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
